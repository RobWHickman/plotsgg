I'm fully obsessed with making maps using 3D LiDAR data at the moment. For some examples of why and the full potential see Sean Conway's work at [Muir Way](https://muir-way.com/collections/vintage-relief).

The easiest way I've seen to get going is using [{EAlidaR}](https://github.com/h-a-graham/EAlidaR) from [Hugh Graham](https://twitter.com/hughagraham) which has some nice tests to get going with [here](https://github.com/h-a-graham/EAlidaR/blob/master/tests/Run_test.R).

These are two simple plots made by doing the bare minimum changes to the code for Cambridge and Oxford which I think work nicely due to the large college Quads which provide nice markers.

_way back before wfh, people used to actually travel to work_

I recently got my hands on a copy of [The Information Capital](https://www.waterstones.com/book/london-the-information-capital/james-cheshire/oliver-uberti/9780141978796) by James Chesire and Oliver Uberti (which is great and you should definitely buy it) and given that I love the city and also love doing plots and stuff with open-source data I thought I'd try my hand at recreating them. This is the first one of these, from page 43 of the book showing commuter flows from the 2011 census. (side note: this is one of the fields of the census that is going to be fucked by Covid-19 in the 2021 update).

## Data Sourcing

★★★★★
Very easy- prep-prepared and released as a csv from the census then a few easily available shapefile sets

## Main Plot Recreation

★★★★☆
Pretty easy once you do a join and cast the two points to a line. Couldn't fully work out how they've coloured and alpha'd the lines but think I got close

## Fiddliness

★★☆☆☆
Pretty fiddly place name labels and making the inset plot

# Code

fully commented code [here]()

      <description>I’m fully obsessed with making maps using 3D LiDAR data at the moment. For some examples of why and the full potential see Sean Conway’s work at Muir Way.
The easiest way I’ve seen to get going is using {EAlidaR} from Hugh Graham which has some nice tests to get going with here.
These are two simple plots made by doing the bare minimum changes to the code for Cambridge and Oxford which I think work nicely due to the large college Quads which provide nice markers.</description>

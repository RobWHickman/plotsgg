<p><em>way back before wfh, people used to actually travel to work</em></p>

<p>I recently got my hands on a copy of <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/london-the-information-capital/james-cheshire/oliver-uberti/9780141978796">The Information Capital</a> by James Chesire and Oliver Uberti (which is great and you should definitely buy it) and given that I love the city and also love doing plots and stuff with open-source data I thought I’d try my hand at recreating them. This is the first one of these, from page 43 of the book showing commuter flows from the 2011 census. (side note: this is one of the fields of the census that is going to be fucked by Covid-19 in the 2021 update).</p>

<div id="data-sourcing" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Sourcing</h2>
<p>★★★★★
Very easy- prep-prepared and released as a csv from the census then a few easily available shapefile sets</p>
</div>
<div id="main-plot-recreation" class="section level2">
<h2>Main Plot Recreation</h2>
<p>★★★★☆
Pretty easy once you do a join and cast the two points to a line. Couldn’t fully work out how they’ve coloured and alpha’d the lines but think I got close</p>
</div>
<div id="fiddliness" class="section level2">
<h2>Fiddliness</h2>
<p>★★☆☆☆
Pretty fiddly place name labels and making the inset plot</p>
</div>
<div id="code" class="section level1">
<h1>Code</h1>

<p><em>hello (to some very small 3D slices of the) world!</em></p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’m fully obsessed with making maps using 3D LiDAR data at the moment. For some examples of why and the full potential see Sean Conway’s work at <a href="https://muir-way.com/collections/vintage-relief">Muir Way</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest way I’ve seen to get going is using <a href="https://github.com/h-a-graham/EAlidaR">{EAlidaR}</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/hughagraham">Hugh Graham</a> which has some nice tests to get going with <a href="https://github.com/h-a-graham/EAlidaR/blob/master/tests/Run_test.R">here</a>.</p>
<p>These are two simple plots made by doing the bare minimum changes to the code for Cambridge and Oxford which I think work nicely due to the large college Quads which provide nice markers.</p>
